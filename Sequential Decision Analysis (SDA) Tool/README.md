# Sequential Decision Analysis (SDA) Templates & Tools

This repository provides templates and tools to apply **Sequential Decision Analysis (SDA)** ‚Äî a structured way to manage **uncertainty in project planning**.

---

## What Is SDA?

SDA (Sequential Decision Analysis) is a decision-making methodology that:
- Breaks the project into **key decision points**, not just fixed timelines
- Uses **decision trees** and expected value calculations to compare options
- Helps you plan with flexibility by anticipating possible outcomes :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## When to Use SDA

- When your project involves **high uncertainty or evolving conditions**
- When you need to **compare options** (e.g., build vs improve)
- When stakeholders require **structured, risk-aware decision-making**

## Why Use SDA?

- It shifts planning from rigid schedules to **decision-based planning**
- It helps you **quantify uncertainties** and **manage risk proactively**
